# merlin
 HTML5 perlin-noise-based infinite map generator.
 
By default rendering is made through semi-optimized canvas drawing, but a pure DOM version can be activated as well. Surprinsingly the gaps in performance is quite small. One major improvement would be to port the rendering to WebGL.
 
 Controls
 * Press C to toggle DOM rendering on/off.
 * Press A and B to control the size of noice cells.
 * Use the mouse wheels to control the zoom level in the noise function.
